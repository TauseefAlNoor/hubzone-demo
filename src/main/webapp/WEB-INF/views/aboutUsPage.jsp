<p>HUBZone Talent is a unique website that matches job seekers living in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones) with companies that have a HUBZone designation.  The Federal Government&apos;s goal is to award 3% of all Federal Government dollars to HUBZone companies.  Because HUBZone companies are required to have 35% of all employees residing in a HUBZone area, it creates a great opportunity to those job seekers living in these areas.</p>
<p>HUBZone talent&apos;s goal is to help make it easier for HUBZone companies to find competent, skilled job seekers that are located in these areas.</p>
